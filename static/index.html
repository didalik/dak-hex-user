<h1>Proof of Concept</h1>
      <p>
      Hi there, I'm Дід Alik and Stellar Help Exchange (HEX) is my hobby project. The project's goal is to establish an equitable marketplace on <a href='https://stellar.org'>Stellar</a> network - if you do not get the help you paid for, you get your payment back. To give you a glimpse on what it is, I recorded this <a href='https://youtu.be/y4TELgx28D4'>video</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      To see how it works, use this Proof-of-Concept Demo - it runs on Stellar TESTNET and provides you with your own copy of the interactions outlined in the video. The demo output lets you analyze its results with <a href='https://laboratory.stellar.org/#?network=test'>Stellar Laboratory</a>, making your review of the project's <a href='https://github.com/didalik/dak-hex-user'>codebase</a> a breeze. <a href='/poc/demo'>Run the demo!</a>
      </p>
      <p>
And you can always take a look at my <a href='https://github.com/didalik/dak-hex-user/blob/main/poc/latest_test.html'>latest test</a> run of the demo.
