# Stellar Help Exchange (HEX) codebase

Presently, the name of this project is misleading: at its inception, it was clear that, as opposed to HEX User, the HEX Agent stuff will not be public. So I made this project public, assuming that its Agent counterpart will be private. Later on, it became clear that:
- a HEX Agent needs not a *project*, but rather a local Linux *account* to keep itself private;
- the HEX codebase MUST be made public;
- the HEX actors (User, Agent, Issuer) need some introduction/description.

So today I added this README.md file to introduce the HEX actors to the public. Am also considering renaming this project to **dak-hex-codebase** - but this can wait... (:

## Stellar HEX Actors

There are tree types of HEX actors - Issuer, Agent, and User.
